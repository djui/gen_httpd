@doc The gen_httpd behaviour implements a generic HTTP server interface.
Since it's an OTP behaviour it fits well under a supervisor, which makes it
very easy to embed in any application. gen_httpd tries to do as little as
possible while still providing enough functionality to deal with the HTTP
protocol, concurrency etc. 

HTTP version 1.1 and 1.0 are supported. Persintant connections are controlled
by the headers included in the response from the client. The default
behaviour reads a request from a socket, wait for the application to return
a response and then read the next request. It is also possibe to use a
concurrent pipeline where a process is spawed for each request received on
the socket.  The responses will be serialised by gen_httpd to the client.
